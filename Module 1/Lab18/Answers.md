7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.
The most commonly rated apps are highly popular apps, which have been available for about a decade (and therefore have been rated continuously for longer than other apps). 
They mostly consist of social media (Facebook, Pinterest) or casual games (Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja Classic)

8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.
Less famous apps, more useful than time-crunching.

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
None of the best rated apps are in the most rated apps. Indeed, the less an app is rated, the less it is likely to be poorly rated. It is unthinkable for an apps rated 1 million times to have only 5 star-ratings, naturally. Therefore, the 2 rankings are not comparable.

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?
I would give priority to the number of votes, because the least rated apps are probably not the most useful either. I would then only select those with a total 5-star rating.

11. Do people care about the price of an app? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
As the data set does not provide the number of downloads, I will use the number of ratings as a measure of popularity. 
First, I will choose the free or almost free apps (<2 USD, because a 0.99 USD app is easily downloaded). The most rated app, EVERNOTE has '2974680' ratings.
For apps >2 USD, the most rated app, CALL OF DUTY, has "only" '105776' ratings. It seems like a significant price can affect the popularity of an app.
